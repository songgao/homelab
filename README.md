This repo holds my notes on my home networking and server setup.

One of its purposes is in case I need to fix stuff in the future and forget how
I set it up. It also serves as a RTFM if I ever get hit by a train and my
family need to keep going with their tech life.

I hope someone else finds this useful too. Feel free to file an issue, start a
discussion, or [shoot me a message](http://keybase.io/songgao/chat) if anything
here needs clarification.

Still a very rough WIP but here's the available content:
